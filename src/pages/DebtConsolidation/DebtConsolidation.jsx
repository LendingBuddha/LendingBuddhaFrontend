          <h2>What is Debt Consolidation & Credit Card Settlement?</h2>
          <p>A debt consolidation loan is a loan taken to pay off other debts. By consolidating many small debts with one debt, one gets favorable payment terms and a lower burden of EMI.</p>
          <p>For example, if someone has many small informal debts or credit card dues (with very high monthly interest rates) causing financial imbalance, they can take a loan through Lending Buddha to fully repay these debts, turning multiple monthly EMIs into a single EMI, which is usually cheaper than the multiple debts.</p>

           <h2>How Can Lending Buddha Help You?</h2>
           <p>Lending Buddha is an Indian peer-to-peer Lending Marketplace that provides loans to individuals through banks, non-banks, and private lenders. Peer-to-peer lending involves borrowing capital from individual or multiple lenders at a negotiated interest rate through an online platform like Lending Buddha.</p>
           <p>Whether it's an informal debt or credit card dues, you can take a loan with Lending Buddha for any personal matter. Debt consolidation through Lending Buddha or peer-to-peer (P2P) lending is a great way to manage all your loans by combining all your outstanding dues into one easy payment system.</p>
           <p>Lending Buddha uses a robust credit assessment procedure, taking into account your salary and 400 other parameters, providing a fair chance to borrowers who may not qualify for traditional bank loans but are financially capable and healthy to repay the loan.</p>
