                    Certain other factors which are also considered while sanctioning loans include company in which you are employed, type of business (in case of sole proprietor), years in service etc. Based on various factors, the lenders will quote the sanction amount, tenure of the loan and the rates of interest.

                    Lending Buddha provides personal loans from as low as INR 50,000 to a maximum of INR 20,00,000, In most of the cases, minimum monthly salary of INR 20,000 is required to get a loan sanctioned. In order to get your loan sanctioned without any hurdle, it is important to have a good credit score. However, Lending Buddha offers loans even for moderate credit score.        </p>
