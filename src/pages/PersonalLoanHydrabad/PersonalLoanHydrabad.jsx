                    Hyderabad is a major economic hub of India. The capital of Telangana as well as the former capital of Andhra Pradesh has achieved impressive growth in automobile parts manufacturing, textiles and apparel, poultry farming and pharmaceuticals. But more than all these, Hyderabad has emerged as a big information technology (IT) centre of the country and with this, the personal finance sector is also taking a more tech driven route.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now banks are not the only way to fulfill financial needs however, technically advanced online portals such as Lending Buddha uses big data analytics and better credit assessment than banks and other traditional financial institutions resulting in a higher approval rate.       </p>
                  <p>Two factors have contributed in a big way to the economic development of Hyderabad. One, it has a huge talent bank that companies can utilize to increase their global competitiveness; and two, the labor market. Additionally, Hyderabad offers a more economical young workforce than in other big cities of the world. As a result, the financial services market in Hyderabad has witnessed phenomenal growth in the past few years with the predominantly young population availing personal loans and credit.</p>
